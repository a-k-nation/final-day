  <p>On Febuary 5th, 2024 there was a shift in the world. A light glimmered on the Earth as the very first Ak Nation movement began. Over the course of the past six months our numbers have greatly increased and fallen to varying degrees. However, the Ak Nation movement has not stopped. The valiant efforts of Ak Nation have continued to flourish even under the trying times known as summer vacation. Ak Nation has proven itself to be a force of good and hope in this world. Our message spread far and wide through the campus of Temple University.</p>
  <p>However, all good things must come to a close. Today is that day. August 5th, 2024, is the Final Day of Ak. You all have shown great valor in the face of adversity and immense strength under the pressure of evil. Going forward in life I hope that you continue to uphold the qualities and values of Ak Nation. From here on forward, we will move in silence. No longer will Ak be restricted to those on the close friends story, but any one can truly embody the beliefs of Ak Nation.</p>
  <p>While today is our final day of public presence, it is not quite goodbye. Please join me for one last request.</p>
